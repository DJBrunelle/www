                I've been interested in computers ever since I can remember. During primary school, it was mostly surfing google and playing
                online games, but once I hit secondary and took my first programming course, I was hooked on coding. Obviously,
                I wanted to learn more and decided to do my degree in the field of Comupter Science. I now have 1 year left
                to finish my degree at MacEwan University, and am very anxiously awaiting what my life will be like once
                I graduate!
